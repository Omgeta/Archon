It would be improper of me to comment, given that I am one of her subjects. All I will say is that... I think that Her Excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.\n\nNot much is known of her personality at the moment other than her nobility, obsession with pursuing eternity, and her cruelty in conducting the Vision Hunt.\n\n**About her relationships**\nIn the [1.5 CN Livestream](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17y4y147fa), it was revealed that she is old friends with [Morax](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Morax) and [Yae](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yae).\n\nShe also naturally has a close relationship with her close aide and bodyguard, [Kujou Sara](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Kujou_Sara).",
