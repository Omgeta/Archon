        "description": "Raiden is the [Shogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun) of [Inazuma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Inazuma) and the [Electro Archon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Archon) of the Seven, representing the divine ideal of Eternity.\n\n**About her name**\nRaiden is referred to in multiple ways: Raiden is her personal name, Baal is her Archon name (from Ars Goetia), and her titles are Shogun and Narukami Ogosho. (source needed from zhonglis voicelines)\n\n**About her personality**\n> The Almighty Shogun? It would be improper of me to comment, given that I am one of her subjects. All I will say is that... I think that Her Excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.\n\nNot much is known of her personality at the moment other than her nobility, obsession with pursuing eternity, and her cruelty in conducting the Vision Hunt.\n\nShe does have a soft side however, seen from her love of the Shiba dog breed.\n\n**About her relationships**\nIn the [1.5 CN Livestream](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17y4y147fa), it was revealed that she is old friends with [Morax](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Morax) and [Yae](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yae).\n\nShe also naturally has a close relationship with her close aide and bodyguard, Kujou Sara.",

        "description": "Both her weapon and skillset are currently unconfirmed but there is some information from dataminers and leakers.\n\n**About her weapon**\nAll official miHoYo media have shown Raiden's weapon as being a sword. *(add imgur link to different pics)*\nHowever, [datamines have shown](https://twitter.com/projectcelestia/status/1404871077394882569?s=19) that her weapon is polearm instead.\nIn the boss fight, she wields both weapons but the weapon that Raiden will equip in her playable form is still unconfirmed.\n\n**About her skillset**\nSkillset data has not yet been datamined and the only information we have is from insider sources.\n\nTrustworthy leakers have stated that Raiden has a [new, unique skillset that is strong](https://twitter.com/SsukunaaA/status/1399027401376419846) and leans towards a supporting style of gameplay. *(still need to add more sources)*\n\nPopular theories about her skillset include having timestop abilities, being completely based on energy recharge, having an \"awakening\" mode change from a polearm support to a sword DPS and having the ability to disable enemies.",
