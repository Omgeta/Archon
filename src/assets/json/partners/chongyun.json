As the heir to a clan of exorcists, he has always possessed abilities superior to most. However, these abilities are not the result of training, but of an inborn trait - a pure yang spirit.\n\nA place for Chongyun mains to come together and discuss builds/teams/strategies for end game Chongyun dps. Also a place for new players to learn of the potential of Chongyun DPS.",
